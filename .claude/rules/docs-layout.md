# Forestrie docs layout

The single convention for Forestrie documentation, from
[devdocs ADR-0071](https://github.com/forestrie/devdocs/blob/main/adr/adr-0071-documentation-system-v2/README.md).
It replaces the old `plan-docs`, `adr-format` and forestrie `save-status`
conventions. Where anything else disagrees (an older repo README, a
vendored `ADR-FORMAT.md`, a hand-written `.cursor/rules` copy), this wins.

Frontmatter schemas (JSON Schema 2020-12) and the machine-checked form of
this specification are in [forestrie/dox](https://github.com/forestrie/dox).
[dox](https://github.com/robinbryce/dox) checks them (`dox lint`) and
allocates ids against the remote (`dox next <type>`, `dox new <type>
<slug>`); set `DOX_SCHEMA_REPO=forestrie/dox`.

## Canon and work

**Canon** says what is true and why. **Work** says what is in flight.

| Type | Role | Home | Schema |
|------|------|------|--------|
| ADR | one decision; immutable once `accepted` | `adr/` in the repo it affects; devdocs when cross-repo; protocol when implementation independent | `adr` |
| ARC | numbered design for an area; retires once realised | `arc/`, same homes as ADRs | `arc` |
| Named living doc | current state of an area, revised in place | anywhere in the owning repo (`architecture.md`, `docs/<area>.md`, runbooks, protocol spec, product briefs) | `named-doc` |
| Rules file | versioned invariants | `protocol/rules/platform.md`; each repo's `docs/rules.md` | `rules` |
| Plan | work in flight | [forestrie/work](https://github.com/forestrie/work) `plans/` | `plan` |
| Status snapshot | resumable checkpoint of a workstream | forestrie/work `status/` | `status` |

- Code repos, devdocs, protocol and product hold **no plans or status
  docs**. Repos that still have them move them to the work home in their
  normalisation change.
- Canon cites canon only. Never put a plan id, status id or tracker id
  (`FOR-123`) in canon prose. Plans may cite anything.
- Do not read the work home to build context. Open a plan by its id, or
  list the plans for an issue by searching `issues:`.

In a repo, canon lives under `docs/` (`docs/adr/`, `docs/arc/`,
`docs/rules.md`, `docs/<area>.md`). devdocs, protocol and product are docs
repos and use the same directories at their root. Until its normalisation
change, protocol keeps its ADRs and ARCs together in `decisions/`.

## Files and directories

- A document is one file, `<id>.md`, or a directory `<id>/` whose
  `README.md` is the document. Other files in the directory are parts of
  it and carry no frontmatter of their own.
- Use a directory only when the document needs parts: an ADR with a
  research appendix, a plan with slices.
- Plan directory layout: `README.md` (the plan, with a slice table),
  `NN-<slug>.md` slices numbered locally from `01`, optional `handoff.md`
  and `decisions.md`. Nothing else (`overview.md`, `subplan-NN-*` are
  retired forms).
- Soft-wrap prose at about 79 characters, breaking at punctuation.

## Ids

The `id` field equals the filename stem, or the directory name for a
directory document.

| Type | id | Allocated by |
|------|----|--------------|
| ADR | `adr-NNNN-<slug>`; `adr-NNNN-sec-<slug>` if security critical | `dox new adr <slug>` in the home |
| ARC | `arc-NNNN-<slug>` | `dox new arc <slug>` in the home |
| Named doc, rules file | `<slug>` | the author |
| Plan | `plan-YYMM-NN-<slug>` | `dox new plan <slug> [--dir]` in forestrie/work |
| Status | `status-YYMM-NN-<slug>` | `dox new status <slug>` in forestrie/work |

- Numbers are 4 digits; plan and status ordinals are 2 digits within the
  month (`YYMM`) the document was created.
- **Allocate against the remote, with dox.** `dox next <type>` and
  `dox new` fetch `origin` and scan its default branch and open pull
  requests across every directory that can hold the series (`retired/`,
  `archive/*/`, and protocol's legacy `decisions/`), never just your
  working tree. Never hand-pick a number. See [dox](../dox/SKILL.md).
- Each repo, plus devdocs, protocol and product, is its own namespace, and
  numbers continue from the highest id already in that home: devdocs from
  ADR-0071, protocol from its existing ADR-0069 and ARC-0019.
- Existing duplicate ids and frozen legacy `plan-NNNN-<slug>` ids keep
  their names. The slug tells them apart; never renumber.

## Citing

- In prose, cite as `<home>:<TYPE>-<NNNN>`: `devdocs:ADR-0071`,
  `canopy:ARC-0004`, `protocol:ADR-0067`. A bare `ADR-0071` is valid only
  inside its own home. Use the full stem (`devdocs:adr-0023-grant-format`)
  when the number is a known duplicate.
- Frontmatter link fields take the same forms, plus repo-relative paths
  (`architecture.md`, `protocol:rules/platform.md#p4`) and https URLs.
- Markdown links: relative within a repo; across repos
  `https://github.com/forestrie/<repo>/blob/main/<path>`. Pin to a commit
  SHA only when pointing at specific lines of code. No `(local: ../...)`
  parentheticals.

## Frontmatter

Every document starts with YAML frontmatter that validates against its
type's schema. No bold `**Status:**` / `**Date:**` header block; the `#`
title follows the frontmatter. Fields outside the schema are rejected,
except `x-<name>` extension fields.

Common to all: `id`, `title`, `status`, `created`, `updated` (dates as
`YYYY-MM-DD`). Rules files have `version` and `amended` instead of
`status` and `updated`.

Typed links, used on any type where they apply:

| Field | Shape | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `supersedes` | list | documents this replaces; each carries `superseded-by` back |
| `superseded-by` | one ref | the document that replaced this one |
| `absorbed-into` | list | living docs or rules that now carry this document's substance |
| `decisions` | list | in-force ADRs and ARCs that shaped this document |
| `refs` | list | anything else: canon, work ids, `FOR-*` issues |

Per type:

| Type | Adds | Required beyond common |
|------|------|------------------------|
| ADR | `categories` (upper case), `amends` | `superseded-by` when `superseded` |
| ARC | `categories` | `absorbed-into` when `absorbed`; `superseded-by` when `superseded` |
| Named doc | `owner` (GitHub user or `org/team`), `review-by` | `owner`, `review-by`, `decisions`; `superseded-by` when `superseded` |
| Plan | `repos`, `issues`, `outcome` | `repos`, `issues`; `outcome` when `complete` |
| Status | `repos`, `issues`, `plans` | — |
| Rules | `version` (semver), `amended` | `version`, `created`, `amended` |

## Status values

| Type | Values |
|------|--------|
| ADR | `discuss`, `ready`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `superseded`, `deprecated` |
| ARC | `draft`, `accepted`, `absorbed`, `superseded`, `abandoned` |
| Named doc | `draft`, `current`, `superseded` |
| Plan, status | `draft`, `active`, `blocked`, `complete`, `abandoned` |
| Rules file | none; versioned |

ADR meanings:

- `discuss`: being debated. Prototypes only if they inform the decision.
- `ready`: sound enough to implement at risk; may still evolve. Do not sink
  significant effort before this.
- `accepted`: stakeholders bought in; applies to production engineering.
- `rejected`: kept so the approach is not re-litigated.
- `superseded`: another ADR replaced it (`superseded-by`).
- `deprecated`: the context went away; nothing replaced it.

`implemented`, `complete`, `proposed`, `historical` and free text are not
ADR statuses. Work done is a plan state.

## Writing an ADR

Write one only when the decision is hard to reverse, surprising without
context, and the result of a real trade-off. Otherwise a comment or a
living-doc note is enough.

Sections: **Context**, **Decision**, **Consequences**, **Implementation**
(if applicable), **Alternatives Considered**, **References**. Scale depth
to reversibility; do not pad a light decision.

Once `accepted`, change only `status`, `updated` and the link fields. A
changed decision is a new ADR with `supersedes:`. A consolidation ADR may
restate a topic and supersede a cluster at once.

## Writing a plan or status doc

Plans and status docs go in a forestrie/work worktree, created with
`dox new plan` and `dox new status` (which `/plan-new` and `/save-status`
run). A plan has a `## Rules check` section
listing each rule id it touches (platform `P#`, repo rule ids), each
marked honoured or amendment proposed with a link. An unjustified
violation blocks the plan and its PRs. Code PRs link the plan; they do not
carry it.

**Closing a plan.** Mark it `complete` only after its durable outcome has
landed in canon (an ADR per decision taken, the ARC or living doc whose
current state changed, a rules amendment if an invariant moved). List
those in `outcome:`, or write `outcome: "none: <reason>"`. Then `git mv`
it to `archive/<YYMM>/` (month closed). Abandoned plans archive the same
way. `dox lint` checks that a closed plan has an `outcome:` and sits in
`archive/`.

## Retiring canon

`adr/` and `arc/` hold the documents an agent should read: those in
force that no living doc has absorbed, and those in discussion. In the same
change that sets `superseded`, `rejected`, `deprecated`, `absorbed` or
`abandoned`, or adds `absorbed-into`, `git mv` the document to
`adr/retired/` or `arc/retired/` and rewrite inbound links to the new path.
Find them first with `dox graph --json` (`backlinks`; afterwards
`into_retired` must not name it).

Retirement by absorption: once a named living doc or rule carries an ADR's
or ARC's substance, record `absorbed-into:` on it and retire it.

- An absorbed **ARC** takes status `absorbed`.
- An absorbed **ADR** keeps its status (normally `accepted`): the decision
  still holds, and ADRs have no `absorbed` status. The absorbing document
  lists it in `decisions:`.
- `superseded-by` appears only on a `superseded` document; a decision that
  merely went away is `deprecated`, with no link.

Never leave a "moved" stub file behind. Never hand-maintain an index of a
series; indexes are generated (`dox index`).

**The baseline.** A repo's `.dox-baseline.json` records findings that
predate its dox gate. It only shrinks: fix a finding, then
`dox lint --update-baseline`. Never hand-edit it or baseline a new
finding.

## Rules files

Platform rules: forestrie/protocol `rules/platform.md` (`P#`). Each
repository's rules: its own `docs/rules.md` (`A#` arbor, `C#` canopy,
`U#` univocity, `T#` univocity-tools, `M#` mandate, `F#` forest-1, `FX#`
arbor-flux). forestrie-agents holds no rule content.

Each rule is one heading, checked by dox (`rules-shape`):

```markdown
### C1 — Offline verify calls nothing
What the rule requires, in a sentence or two.
**Why:** what breaks if it is violated.
[ADR-0045](https://github.com/forestrie/protocol/blob/main/adr/adr-0045-receipt-verify-offline-contract.md).
**Enforced-by:** test:<path of a test that fails if the rule breaks>, review
```

- **Enforced-by** lists what fails when the rule breaks: `hook:<name>`,
  `lint:<check>`, `test:<path>`, or `review` when nothing mechanical does.
  `review`-only rules are the mechanisation backlog.
- A repository rule that narrows a platform rule says so: `⤷ specialises
  P2`. It never restates the platform rule.
- Fundamental only: if breaking it would not break the trust, economic or
  decentralisation model, or a headline product claim, it belongs in an
  ADR, not here.
- Bump `version` and `amended` in the amending change: MAJOR removes or
  redefines a rule, MINOR adds one, PATCH rewords. Link the amendment from
  the ADR that motivated it, and tick **rules** in the PR's Docs impact
  block.

**The digest.** Every session loads `.claude/rules/rules-of-the-road.md`:
one line per platform and repository rule, generated by `dox digest`
between `dox:digest` markers (devdocs ADR-0074). The repository's
`.dox.toml` names it and pins the platform rules at a protocol tag:

```toml
[digest]
out = ".claude/rules/rules-of-the-road.md"
include = ["protocol:rules/platform.md@rules-v1.0.0"]
```

After changing `docs/rules.md` or bumping the pin, run `dox digest` and
commit the result; CI's `digest-fresh` fails otherwise.
